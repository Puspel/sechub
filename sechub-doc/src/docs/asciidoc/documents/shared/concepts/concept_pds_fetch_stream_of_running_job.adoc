We use `error.txt` and `output.txt` inside the workspace location of 
a running PDS job.

The PDS job process does not store the files on a shared volume or S3 bucket
but on the local file system (like done for uploaded source files for example).

So we can easily write those text content from the files to our database when 
the OS process (executing PDS caller script) has finished or failed, because
at this time we have direct access to the files.


But when an administrator wants to get the current output for a running job
/ operation this becomes tricky in a clustered environment, because the process 
stream data is only available on the machine where the job is executed. 
Using a loadbalancer we do not know which machine will be used for the REST 
operation.

So it becomes necessary, that the executing cluster member will store the
error and output text data in database to provide this cluster wide.

On the other hand it shall not slow down or block the execution machine because of
permanent updates inside the DB. If an admin wants to check the output or 
error stream content of a running job, the information shall be gathered on demand.
But when the job has finished _(no matter if canceled, done or failed)_ the information will always be written to DB. 

The next figure gives an overview about the workflow to achieve this goal:
