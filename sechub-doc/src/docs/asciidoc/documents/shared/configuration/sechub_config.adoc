=== SecHub configuration

A `{sechub}` configuration  must be valid `JSON` and is defined
at caller side.

It is used by client and also by rest calls to start {sechub}
scan jobs and add meta data. 

Some minor parts are client specific and must
be handled by direct REST calls in a special way or do just not exist. 
But this is mentioned inside this documentation

==== API version
`apiVersion` must be defined (so mandatory). Currently only `1.0` is valid.

[NOTE]
====
As long as the SecHub configuration is still strongly developed,
the API version remains - despite changes - to 1.0.

During this time, however, the API always remains backwards compatible!
====

==== Server
`server` (optional) defines the location to `{sechub}` server.
Information can be used by client implementations.

NOTE: When using REST calls directly you do not need the information inside
      configuration because you use server URL in every call...

==== Project
`project` (optional) defines the project to use. Information can be used by
client implementations.

NOTE: When using REST calls directly you do not need the information inside
      configuration because you use project id inside URL.

==== Code scan
`codeScan` (optional) defines the code scan settings.

===== Upload sources from file system
Define `fileSystem` child entry and setup folders to use for code scanning by
`folders` sub entry.

All source code files inside these folders will be automatically zipped and uploaded by `{sechub}` client
to server side for ongoing source analysis.

Pathes must be defined relative from caller location - for example
on a Jenkins Build Server this is normally the root folder of repository.

NOTE: The configuration parts inside `fileSystem` entry are interpreted by
      `{sechub}` client! When you directly use the REST API you do not need
      to define this data but you have to upload sources as a `zip`file by
      your own over REST!

[WARNING]
====
Please do *NOT* use `\` inside pathes *but* always `/`.

Also do *NOT* use absolute pathes *but* always relative pathes! Normally you should
call {sechub} inside root folder of your source repository - this is the standard situation
on build servers.
====

===== Example sechub.json

[[sechub-config-example-sourcescan]]
[source, json]
----
include::sechub_config_example1_sourcescan_filesystem.json[]
----
<1> Define code scan
<2> Use filesystem - so means upload sources to server
<3> Upload will contain sources from `gamechanger-android/src/main/java` and `gamechanger-server/src/main/java` and their sub folders
<4> Exclude directories (optional), syntax is similar to https://ant.apache.org/manual/Types/fileset.html[ANT fileset] - ` +
    In example above all files in following directories are excluded from upload: +
    * `+**/mytestcode/**+` +
    excludes all files under a directory named `build` including sub directories
    * `+**/documentation/**+` +
    same for folder `documentation`
    * default excludes +
     Per default, the directories `+**/test/**+` `+**/.git/**+`
are already excluded:

<5> Client only option - if you use REST directly, you can ignore this. +
    {sechub} client does only add wellknown sources into created upload zip file. This removes
    unnecessary stuff and reduces upload size automatically. +
    _E.g. a codescan for a `JPEG` image would not make sense..._ +
    Instead of defining a negative list, we use a positive list and accept only wellknown sources,
    which is simply done by file ending. + 
    In the example we allow also ".cplusplus" and ".py9" as additional accepted source files.
    Inside client documentation you will find a list of the default file endings.  

==== Web scan
`webScan` (optional) defines the web scan settings.

===== URIs
Use `uri` element to define a string array containing uris you want to scan.

WARNING: URI must be one of the whitelisted URLs of your project. Otherwise it will be rejected.
         So you are not able to start scanning foreign domains and do _accidently_ an DoS attack...

====== Example anonymous
[[sechub-config-example-webscan-anonymous]]
[source, json]
----
include::sechub_config_example2_webscan_anonyous.json[]
----
<1> Define web scan
<2> The `URI` s to scan. Every `URI` listed here must be white listed in `{sechub}` project.
<3> *Optional*: Define the maximum duration the scan can take. 
    Scanning a "large" web page/application can take several hours or even days. 
    This option ensures the scan will only run for a limited time.
<4> Define the unit of time. 
    The unit can be: `millisecond`, `second`, `minute`, `hour`, `day`.

===== Login
A web scan does work very much better if it has got access to all content
 - so a login is necessary most time. If you do not define a login configuration
 your web scan will be done only as anonymous user.

[CAUTION]
====
Providing login will enable web scanner to execute ALL possible
actions!

An example: Your test application has a Web UI for sending SMS which can
be triggered by an user. Then a web scan can trigger those operations as well!

If you do this inside an environment where a real SMS provider is connected,
this could result into mass SMS and also in a bigger invoice from your
SMS provider - *so be careful!*
====

====== Options

SecHub provides you with 3 options for login:

* basic authentication
* form based login
** auto detect
** script based

[NOTE]
====
When a web scan product (or its adapter) does not support your wanted options you
will have a failure at execution time!
====



====== Example basic authentication
[source,json]
----
include::sechub_config_example3_webscan_login_basicauth.json[]
----
<1> URL for web login
<2> Basic authentication start, needs user id/name and password.
<3> *Optional*: You can set the realm used for basic authentication. But normally
    this is not necessary

====== Example form based login with auto detect
[source,json]
----
include::sechub_config_example4_webscan_login_form_autodetect.json[]
----
<1> URL for web login
<2> Start of form based login with auto detection. +
    In this example you see variables in `go template` format. This is {sechub} client specific.
    If you use REST API directly, you must you must use real values!

====== Example form based login by script
[source,json]
----
include::sechub_config_example5_webscan_login_from_sript.json[]
----
<1> URL for web login.
<2> Start of form based login.
<3> Script definition.
<4> Pages section. A page is a visible page. Some logins need more than one page.
<5> The actions which should be executed on each page. 
<6> Type of action. Valid types are : +
    - `username` +
      name of user used for login
    - `password` +
      password entered at login
    - `input` +
      setup value for a field on UI
    - `click` +
      will simulate a mouse click on UI
    - `wait` + 
      time to wait before executing the next action
<7> Selector (CSS) to identify web element.
<8> Value, used by most actions (`username|password|input|wait`). +
    In this examples you see variables
    in `go template` format. This is {sechub} client specific.
    If you use the REST API directly, you must use real values!
<9> A description can be added to explain an action.
<10> The time the next action will be delayed.
<11> Define the unit of time. 
     The unit can be: `millisecond`, `second`, `minute`, `hour`, `day`.

WARNING: `username` and `password` are like input but {sechub} tries
         to hide these information in logs or at UI where possible.
         So do *NOT* use `input` for credentials!

==== Infrastructure scan
`infraScan` (optional) defines the infrastructure scan settings.

===== URIs
Use `uris` element to define a string array containing `URIs` you want to scan.


====== Example infrascan one URI
[[sechub-config-example-infrascan-with-uri]]
[source, json]
----
include::sechub_config_example7_infrascan_uri.json[]
----
<1> Define infrastructure scan
<2> The `URI` s to scan. Every `URI` listed here must be white listed in `{sechub}` project.

===== IPs
Use `ips` element to define a string array containing `IPs` you want to scan.

====== Example infrascan one IP
[[sechub-config-example-infrascan-with-ip]]
[source, json]
----
include::sechub_config_example6_infrascan_ip.json[]
----
<1> Define infrastructure scan
<2> The `IP` s to scan. Every `IP` listed here must be white listed in `{sechub}` project.
    The given example with `127.0.0.1` represents only an example and will always not work
    because scanners do not scan them self.
